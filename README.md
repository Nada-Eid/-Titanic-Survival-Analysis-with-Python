# 🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis with Python  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **Titanic dataset** to explore factors influencing **passenger survival rates**. Using **Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib**, we perform **data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis** to uncover key patterns in survival based on **class, age, gender, and fare**.  

## 📊 Key Features  
✔ **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values and preprocessing data.  
✔ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Insights into survival trends.  
✔ **Visualizations:** Heatmaps, bar charts, and histograms for better understanding.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes passenger details such as:  
- `Survived`: 0 = No, 1 = Yes  
- `Pclass`: Ticket class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
- `Sex`: Male or Female  
- `Age`: Passenger age  
- `Fare`: Ticket price  
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for data visualization  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-analysis.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd titanic-analysis
   ```  
3. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```  
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Titanic Task.ipynb`) and run all cells.  

## 📌 Key Findings  
- **Women and children had higher survival rates.**  
- **1st-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in 3rd class.**  
- **Higher fares correlated with better survival chances.**
